"""
sample code from https://nerdparadise.com/programming/pygame/part6

A program to explain PyGame methods: 
1. pygame.key.get_pressed() - will get a list of booleans that describes the state of each keyboard key. 
The value of the key constant (such as pygame.K_TAB) can be used as the index into this giant list. 
Therefore pygame.key.get_pressed()[pygame.K_TAB] is an expression that is true when the tab key is pressed.

2. pygame.mouse.get_pos() - returns the coordinates of the mouse cursor. Will return (0, 0) if the mouse 
hasn't moved over the screen yet.

3. pygame.mouse.get_pressed() - like pygame.key.get_pressed(), returns the state of each mouse button. 
The value returned is a tuple of size 3 that corresponds to the left, middle, and right buttons.

This program completes following tasks:
--Moving the mouse causes a trail to be drawn after it.
--Pressing W while holding Ctrl will close the window. Same for Alt + F4.
--Pressing the close button will close the window
--Pressing r, g, or b keys will make the trail turn red, green, and blue respectively.
--Pressing the left mouse button will cause the trail to become thicker.
--Pressing the right mouse button will cause the trail to become thinner.
